This project is made using React

There are various destinations of Uttarakhand for travelling
and the user can select not interested if he is not interested in going there.Then onclicking the not interested button ,that card will automatically disappear from the list 

If all are selected not interested then only refresh button would be left in the page the user can then select refresh button to take all the cards back.

Various effects like hovering,shadowing etc are done for making cards more attractive.
